#Prerequisites
#An AWSEC2/Azure VM instance with centos-7+
#Installation steps:
#Add a EPEL (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)third party repository to get packages for Ansible
sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
#Install Ansible to vm we will reference this vm as controller

yum install ansible -y 
#Check Ansible version

ansible --version
#Create a new user for ansible administration & grant admin access to user (Master and Slave)

useradd ansadmin
passwd ansadmin
# below command addes ansadmin to sudoers file. But strongly recommended to use "visudo" command if you are aware vi or nano editor. 
echo "ansadmin ALL=(ALL) ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
#Using keybased authentication is advised. If you are still at learning stage use password based authentication (Master & Slave)

# sed command replaces "PasswordAuthentication no to yes" without editing file
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# add below line
#PasswordAuthentication yes  and comment this one PasswordAuthentication no
# Then restart sshd service with below cmd

service sshd restart
 
#Login as a ansadmin user on master and generate ssh key (ansible controller)

ssh-keygen -t rsa # go with all default, keep on hitting enter until it reaches to key generetion last step
#Copy keys onto all ansible client nodes (Master)

ssh-copy-id <target-server> # here target-server is the one where we will do all installation with ansible.
Update target servers ip on /etc/ansible/hosts file (controller) 
# above same we can do in a txt file in local directory with follwing info target ansible_host=<targer-server ip> ansible_ssh_pass=Passw0rd

echo "<target server IP>" > /etc/ansible/hosts #this command needs you to be root
#Run ansible command as ansadmin user it should be successful (Master)
ansible all -m ping
ansible target -m ping -i inventory # in case we have created local inventory
